/**
 * Assembles a Vercel Build Output API v3 directory for one of the demo apps,
 * from a `dist/` that was produced LOCALLY.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — the demos cannot be built on a Vercel builder
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * Verified on 2026/08/05 in a clean `git worktree` + `npm ci` of this branch:
 * `tsc --noEmit` and `vite build` both fail outright, because two generated
 * Compact contract modules are gitignored and absent from a fresh checkout —
 *
 *   contracts/managed/account/…
 *   contracts/managed/midnames/…
 *
 * Producing them needs the `compact` compiler, which does not exist on a
 * Vercel builder. The Midnames one cannot be produced there at any price: its
 * `.compact` source is not in this repository at all — it is fetched from a
 * pinned upstream revision by the prototype's `npm run midnames:prepare`.
 * The proving keys under `public/zk/**` have the same provenance, and the SRS
 * slices under `public/zk-params/**` are ~45 MB of upstream binaries.
 *
 * So the honest shape is: build where the artefacts already are (here), and
 * upload the finished output with `vercel deploy --prebuilt`. Nothing is
 * recompiled in the cloud and no generated artefact is committed.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 * ------------
 *   node scripts/build-vercel-output.mjs <app-directory>
 *
 * The Passport demo is deployed by .github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml, from a
 * published GitHub release, which sets the VITE_* values, calls this, and
 * uploads. `npm run deploy:passport:manual` does the same from a laptop and is
 * break-glass only — see docs/demo/deployment.md. `npm run deploy:raffle` and
 * the other deploy:* scripts are still the normal path for their apps.
 *
 * One of those values reads like a special case and is not. The Passport
 * deployment sets `VITE_RAFFLE_URL` — not `VITE_LOCAL_APP_URL`, the variable third-party
 * developers are handed for the same grid slot. The two are deliberately
 * separate entries in `examples/passport-demo/src/lib/registry.ts`: the raffle
 * one carries the id `raffle-demo`, its own description, and the illustrated
 * card the Apps grid keys off that id, none of which the generic local slot
 * has. Moving the deployed raffle onto `VITE_LOCAL_APP_URL` would therefore
 * change what ships, so the two variables stay distinct and this script's
 * callers keep naming the raffle one. Nothing here reads either variable —
 * both are consumed by `vite build` before this script runs.
 *
 * Each app directory must be linked to its Vercel project once, first:
 *
 *   cd examples/passport-demo && vercel link --scope utkarsh232s-projects \
 *     --project midnight-passport-app --yes
 *   cd examples/raffle-demo   && vercel link --scope utkarsh232s-projects \
 *     --project midnight-raffle-demo --yes
 *
 * `vercel link` appends a VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN to the app's `.env.local` and
 * writes an `examples/<app>/.gitignore`. Delete both afterwards — the token is
 * a credential nothing here needs, and `.vercel/` is already ignored at the
 * repository root.
 *
 * 1. Copies `<app>/dist` to `<app>/.vercel/output/static`, minus any path
 *    listed in the optional `<app>/.vercel-output-exclude` (one dist-relative
 *    path per line, `#` comments). It exists so the Passport demo can drop the
 *    ~64 MB of local-devnet proving keys no public visitor can ever use. It is
 *    a separate file because Vercel's vercel.json schema rejects unknown keys.
 * 2. Translates `<app>/vercel.json` into `<app>/.vercel/output/config.json`:
 *    `headers[]` become `continue: true` routes, then the filesystem handler,
 *    then `rewrites[]`. That is Vercel's own ordering — redirects, filesystem,
 *    rewrites — so the committed `vercel.json` stays the single description of
 *    the routing, readable by anyone who has never run this script.
