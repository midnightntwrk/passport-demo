/**
 * Tags a production deploy as a GitHub release.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026/09/03)
 * ----------------------------
 * The rule from review is that every production deploy is backed by a GitHub
 * release tag — nothing fancy, just the release tag, so that "what is live"
 * is a question with an answer. The first deploy was tagged by hand, which is
 * exactly the step that gets skipped at the end of a long day. So it runs from
 * the deploy script instead.
 *
 * It is the LAST step of `deploy:passport:manual`, after Vercel has accepted
 * the upload. A tag for a deploy that failed would be worse than no tag.
 *
 * WHAT THE RELEASE IS (2026/09/15)
 * --------------------------------
 *   tag     v<major>.<minor>
 *   title   v<major>.<minor> - YYYY/MM/DD
 *   body    the build id, the commit, and the production URL, then ONLY the
 *           RELEASE-NOTES.md entries that were not already there at the
 *           previous release
 *
 * The number says what the release carried, which a flat count never did:
 *
 *   - the next release is **v1.0** — the count starts again, deliberately;
 *   - a patch or a bug fix moves the DECIMAL: v1.0 -> v1.1 -> v1.2
 *     (`--kind fix`, and that is the default);
 *   - a new feature moves the WHOLE NUMBER and resets the decimal: v1.2 -> v2.0
 *     (`--kind feature`).
 *
 * The scheme is Hector's, from the 2026/09/15 review. The undotted `v1`-`v16`
 * that preceded it stay exactly where they are — they are history, and the
 * builds they carry are still downloadable — but they are ignored when the next
 * number is derived, which is what makes the next release v1.0 and not v17.0.
 * They decide one thing only: with no dotted release yet, the release the notes
 * delta is taken against is v16, so v1.0's body is what changed since v16
 * rather than the whole cumulative file.
 *
 * THE BODY IS A DELTA (2026/09/08)
 * --------------------------------
 * It used to be the whole "## Fixed" section, on the assumption stated in
 * RELEASE-NOTES.md's own header that the file was rewritten before every
 * deploy. It never was — it is the changelog, and it is cumulative. So v10
 * published forty-two fixes in 51,000 characters, the same text v1 to v8 had
 * carried, and the reviewer could not tell from it what that deploy changed.
 *
 * The previous release is the highest dotted release below the one being
 * created, falling back to the highest legacy `v<N>` when there is none; its
 * RELEASE-NOTES.md is read with `git show <tag>:RELEASE-NOTES.md`, and the body
 * carries the entries whose bold title is not in it, one line each. The full
 * prose stays in the file. A body over 4,000 characters is refused: that is a
 * deploy that should have been two (`--allow-long` insists).
 *
 * It is NOT a pre-release. That was the first scheme's real mistake: GitHub
 * never shows a pre-release as "Latest", so a reviewer reading the repository
 * front page saw a three-day-old release and concluded nothing had shipped.
 *
 * The number is derived from what both sources of truth say — the tag refs
 * (`git ls-remote --tags`) and the releases (`gh release list`) — so a tag
 * pushed without a release, or a release whose tag was deleted, still counts.
 * Only `v<major>.<minor>` names count; anything else is not a release under
 * this scheme.
 * The derivation itself lives in `release-naming.mjs` and is unit-tested.
 *
 * The build id is the one the service worker carries — see the header of
 * `examples/passport-demo/public/sw.js` — and is read from `dist/sw.js`, the
 * stamped copy, because that is the identity the installed client reports
 * back. A body naming a build id is therefore checkable against a browser:
 * ask the service worker for its BUILD_ID and the two agree, or the client is
 * running something other than what was released.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES
 * ---------------
 * A dirty tree (`git status --porcelain` says anything at all, uncommitted or
 * untracked) and an unauthenticated `gh`. Both mean the release would name a
 * commit that is not what was uploaded, which is the whole thing the rule is
 * for. It also refuses an unstamped `__BUILD_ID__`, which means the build did
 * not run, RELEASE-NOTES.md with no "## Fixed" section, and a body over 4,000
 * characters — which means one deploy carried several deploys' worth of change
 * (`--allow-long` publishes it anyway).
 *
 * It is idempotent for one commit and build: a release that already names both
 * is reported rather than released twice. A later gate-only commit may carry
 * identical PWA bytes after an immutable release failed before deployment, so
 * it receives a replacement release rather than being trapped behind the old
 * build id. A release missing its ZK artefact bundle is refused: published
 * GitHub releases are immutable, so that omission needs a new replacement
 * release, not a misleading successful re-run.
 *
 * USAGE
 * -----
 *   node scripts/tag-release.mjs [options]
 *
 *   --dry-run            print the tag it would create and the `gh release
 *                        create` command, then exit, creating nothing. The
 *                        preflight checks still run — they are read-only. On a
 *                        build that is ALREADY released it says so and still
 *                        prints the body that release's delta comes to, rather
 *                        than stopping at "nothing to create": the point of a
 *                        dry run is to see the tag and the body.
 *   --kind fix|feature   what this release carries, and so which part of the
 *                        number moves. `fix` (the default) takes the decimal up
 *                        one; `feature` takes the whole number up one and
 *                        resets the decimal. Neither applies to the first
 *                        release of the scheme, which is v1.0 either way.
 *   --allow-long         publish a body over 4,000 characters anyway. Reach
 *                        for it only when the long body is genuinely one
 *                        release; the refusal is usually telling you that a
 *                        deploy carried more than it should have.
 *   --repo <owner/name>  the repository to release in. Default
 *                        `midnightntwrk/passport-demo`, the repository the
 *                        Foundation reviews and releases from (delivery rule,
 *                        2026/09/15). The old working repository is retired for
 *                        pushes and is never released into.
 *   --commit <sha>       the commit the release points at. Default HEAD. An
 *                        older deploy is not at HEAD any more, and the carried
 *                        commit has a different sha in passport-demo; naming it
 *                        also makes the notes come from THAT commit's
 *                        RELEASE-NOTES.md rather than from the working tree,
 *                        so the release says what that build shipped. It is
 *                        resolved against the repository this is RUN in, so
 *                        the mirror release is made from a passport-demo
 *                        checkout, not from here.
 *   --build-id <id>      the service-worker build id. Default: read from the
 *                        stamped `dist/sw.js`. Needed when releasing a deploy
 *                        that is not the last thing built here — mirroring
 *                        into passport-demo, or filling in a release after the
 *                        fact — because `dist/` has moved on.
 *
 *   The commit has to be on the remote already; if it is not, `gh` says so and
 *   this exits non-zero — push, then re-run.
 *
 *   PASSPORT_RELEASE_REPO    same as `--repo` (the flag wins).
 *   PASSPORT_RELEASE_NOTES   the gate summary, appended to the body verbatim.
 *                            Whatever was actually run: typecheck, unit tests,
 *                            the PWA check, a browser walk.
 *   PASSPORT_RELEASE_URL     default `https://midnightpassport.com`.
