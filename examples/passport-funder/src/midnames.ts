/**
 * Sponsored `.night` registration — the funder registers a name FOR a user and
 * pays for all of it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Until now a Passport user paid for their own alias: the funder dripped them
 * activation-sized NIGHT and their wallet then spent 10 atomic NIGHT on the
 * registration. That still means the user's wallet has to hold NIGHT, and a
 * wallet that has to hold NIGHT has to be funded, watched, and settled first.
 *
 * The deployed `.night` TLD does not require any of that. Its registration
 * entrypoint is
 *
 *     register_domain_for(owner, domain, len, resolver)
 *
 * and `owner` is an ARGUMENT, not the caller. The compiled circuit (see
 * `_register_domain_for_0` in the pinned build) derives the CALLER's public key
 * from the `secretKey` witness, compares it with the TLD's own `DOMAIN_OWNER`,
 * and — when they differ, which for us they always do — asserts `BUY_ENABLED`
 * and takes `COST` in unshielded NIGHT from the caller. It then writes
 * `domains[domain] = { owner, resolver }` and adds the name to
 * `domains_owned[owner]`. So a third party can pay for a name that the registry
 * records as belonging to somebody else, which is exactly the shape of
 * sponsorship the Midnames team would run themselves.
 *
 * This module makes the funder that third party:
 *
 *   1. it deploys the resolver leaf with `DOMAIN_TARGET = [contractAddress,
 *      AddressType.ContractAddr]` (the user's account-custody contract) and
 *      `DOMAIN_OWNER` = the owner key the caller supplied; then
 *   2. it calls `register_domain_for` on the network's TLD with that same owner
 *      key, paying COST from the funder's own NIGHT and the fee from the
 *      funder's own DUST.
 *
 * The user's wallet signs nothing, spends nothing, and needs to hold nothing.
 * Ownership on the registry is the user's key: only a holder of the secret
 * behind it can later call `set_resolver` or `transfer_domain`.
 *
 * NO SPONSOR SERVICE HERE
 * -----------------------
 * The demo's browser path hands its fee leg to the ProofStation gateway,
 * because a passkey wallet holds no DUST. The funder is the opposite case: it
 * registers its NIGHT for DUST generation at start-up and owns its fees. Asking
 * a sponsor to pay for the service that pays for everyone else would add a
 * dependency and a failure mode for nothing.
 *
 * PROVENANCE
 * ----------
 * The contract handling is a server-side port of
 * `the repository root/src/integrations/midnames/preview.ts`
 * (Midnames rev 83f8422b, compact 0.31.1) — the original Node integration. The
 * pure helpers (label normalisation, the reserved list, the cost table, the
 * owner-key hash, the padded-key encoding) are COPIED from
 * `examples/passport-demo/src/identity/midnames.ts` rather than imported, so
 * the service has no build-time dependency on the PWA. They must stay
 * byte-identical: a label the browser normalises one way and the service
 * another would register a name the user never typed.
