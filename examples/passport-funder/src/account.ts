/**
 * The activation grant, paid INTO the user's account-custody contract.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `/activate` drips NIGHT to a wallet ADDRESS. That was the right first move,
 * and it is the wrong final one: a Passport's value is supposed to live in its
 * account-custody contract (the ACC), not in the passkey wallet that happens to
 * have deployed it. A grant that lands on the wallet address puts the user back
 * in the position the whole design exists to avoid — holding, watching, and
 * spending from a wallet — and it has to be moved into the contract afterwards
 * by a second transaction the user pays for.
 *
 * So the grant is deposited straight into the contract instead. The ACC's
 * entrypoint for that is
 *
 *     deposit_night(color, amount)
 *
 * and it is PERMISSIONLESS: no `require_device()`, no witness, no caller check.
 * It calls `receiveUnshielded(color, amount)` — which makes the transaction owe
 * the contract that many coins — and then mirrors the credit into the
 * `night_balances` map so the balance is readable from decoded ledger state.
 * Anyone may fund an account; the funder is just the first anyone.
 *
 * The funder therefore calls the circuit itself, paying the coins from its own
 * NIGHT and the fee from its own DUST. The user's wallet signs nothing, spends
 * nothing, and — this is the point — never holds the grant at all. The value
 * exists inside the contract from the moment it exists.
 *
 * WHAT THE FUNDER CANNOT DO
 * -------------------------
 * The compiled account contract declares three witnesses — `device_secret`,
 * `grant_secret`, `recovery_secret` — and every circuit that MOVES value out of
 * an account demands one of them. The funder's witness set (below) is three
 * refusals. `deposit_night` never asks for one, so the deposit path is
 * unaffected; every other path is impossible from this process, by construction
 * rather than by discipline.
 *
 * PROVENANCE
 * ----------
 * The contract is `contracts/account.compact` at the repository root
 * and the circuit handling mirrors that prototype's own client
 * (`src/wallet/account.ts` — `depositNight`). The provider set, the artefact
 * reader, and the transaction-identifier handling are the shared ones in
 * `./contractRuntime.ts`, the same ones `./midnames.ts` registers names with.
