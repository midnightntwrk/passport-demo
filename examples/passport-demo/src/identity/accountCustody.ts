/**
 * Account-custody contract (ACC) — reads and value flows, browser edition.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 * ------------
 * `./passportContract.ts` DEPLOYS one instance of `account.compact` per
 * Passport. This module is that module's other half: it READS the deployed
 * instance's ledger and CALLS its circuits. Under the ruling that every value
 * flow routes through the ACC, the balances Home shows are the contract's
 * `night_balances` and `coins` maps — not the wallet's — and moving money is a
 * `withdraw_night` / `withdraw_shielded` / `deposit_*` call against the
 * contract. The passkey wallet is the signer and the fee payer; the contract is
 * the account.
 *
 * Every export here either returns something the chain answered with, or
 * throws {@link AccountCustodyError} naming what really went wrong. There is no
 * path that reports a transfer that was not submitted, and no path that reports
 * a balance that was not decoded from ledger state served by the indexer.
 *
 * IT IS A SIBLING OF `./passportContract.ts` AND `./midnames.ts`
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * Those two are the proven shapes in this repository for "a browser talks to a
 * real Compact contract on the network the open wallet signs on", so this
 * module copies them deliberately rather than inventing a third way:
 *
 *   - the compiled contract module is loaded through the SAME single literal
 *     specifier both siblings use — `loadContractModule` in
 *     `./contractRuntime.ts` — so the bundler and Node both resolve ONE module
 *     record (see the two-runtime note on {@link loadAccountContract});
 *   - ZK artefacts load over URL through `FetchZkConfigProvider` pointed at
 *     `/zk/account` — the directory `scripts/prepare-zk-assets.mjs` stages and
 *     the Vite middleware serves. Nothing here touches `node:fs`;
 *   - fees are sponsored, and only sponsored. Every write here goes through
 *     the one balancing path both siblings use: when the sponsor has not said
 *     it can pay, the call is refused with the sponsor's own reason and
 *     nothing is built, proved, or signed. No path reads or spends this
 *     wallet's dust.
 *
 * THE PROVIDER PLUMBING IS NOW SHARED, NOT DUPLICATED (2026/08/24)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * Until the ledger-9 port, each of the three modules carried its own copy of
 * the provider set, the private-state store, and the balancing pair — on the
 * argument that one self-contained module per flow keeps a change to one
 * flow's fee handling from silently moving another's. Three copies of the same
 * six API differences is not a port, it is three ports, and the copies had
 * already drifted. They now share `./contractRuntime.ts`, which is where the
 * differences are documented; the behaviour is unchanged.
 *
 * THE DEVICE SECRET IS NOT OURS TO INVENT
 * ---------------------------------------
 * The contract only accepts the device whose commitment it was DEPLOYED with,
 * and that commitment came from `derivePassportContractSecrets` in
 * `./passportContract.ts`. So the device secret every gated call here needs is
 * that same derivation's `deviceSecret` and nothing else —
 * {@link deriveAccountDeviceSecret} re-exposes it so no caller has to
 * re-derive from memory of how it was done.
 *
 * NETWORK ID: like both siblings, this module never calls `setNetworkId`. The
 * live wallet owns the process-wide network id, and moving it would corrupt
 * every address the wallet then encodes.
