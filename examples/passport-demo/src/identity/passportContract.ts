/**
 * The Passport account-custody contract (C1) — browser edition.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 * ------------
 * One deployed instance of `account.compact` per Passport. It holds the device
 * commitment derived from this Passport's passkey, the recovery commitment, and
 * the 2-of-3 recovery shares; from there it custodies NIGHT and shielded coins
 * and carries the grant table. Deploying it is a REAL transaction on whichever
 * network the open wallet signs on — nothing here simulates a deployment.
 *
 * THE NETWORK-GENERAL PATH
 * ------------------------
 * This module takes the open {@link LocalMidnightWallet} — the passkey-derived
 * wallet — and deploys on `wallet.network.networkId`, whatever that is. A
 * localnet is not a mode: the wallet is pointed at it, so the deployment lands
 * there, by exactly the same code that reaches stagenet.
 *
 * WHERE THE CONTRACT COMES FROM (2026/08/24)
 * ------------------------------------------
 * `examples/passport-balancer/contracts-stagenet/managed/account`, staged into
 * this workspace by `scripts/prepare-zk-assets.mjs`. That is the build the
 * stagenet deployment harness used — compactc 0.33.0-rc.2, language 0.25.0,
 * runtime 0.18.0-rc.1 — and the ONLY source change from the preview contracts
 * was the pragma. It replaces the reach into
 * the repository root's `npm run compile`, whose managed output is a 0.31.1 /
 * runtime-0.16 build that the ledger-9 runtime refuses on sight:
 * `checkRuntimeVersion` is the generated module's second line.
 *
 * That reach also took the prototype's `PassportAccount` client and its
 * witness helpers with it, and those bound `@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-
 * contracts` 4.x from inside the prototype's own tree. The deploy is expressed
 * here instead, against midnight-js 5, in the eleven lines it actually takes.
 * Only the Shamir split is still imported from the prototype — it is byte-wise
 * GF(256) arithmetic with no dependency on any SDK, and duplicating a secret
 * sharing implementation to avoid one import would be the worse trade.
 *
 * All the ledger-9 plumbing — providers, the sponsored/local balancing pair,
 * the ZK config provider, transaction-id resolution — lives in
 * `./contractRuntime.ts`, shared with `./midnames.ts` and `./accountCustody.ts`.
 * The six API differences that mattered are documented there.
 *
 * NETWORK ID: like `./midnames.ts`, this module never calls `setNetworkId`. The
 * live wallet owns the process-wide network id, and moving it would corrupt
 * every address the wallet then encodes.
 *
 * HONESTY: no code path here reports a DEPLOYMENT that did not come back from
 * the chain, and `ledgerConfirmed` is only true when the indexer was seen
 * serving state at that address.
 *
 * Since 2026/08/31 there is a second, weaker thing this module can report, and
 * it is deliberately a different type with a different name. A SUBMISSION —
 * {@link PassportContractSubmission} — carries the contract address before the
 * chain has been asked, because the address is a pure function of the initial
 * contract state the constructor just produced and is therefore known the
 * moment the transaction is built rather than the moment it lands. It has no
 * `ledgerConfirmed` field at all, so it cannot be mistaken for a deployment; it
 * carries a `settled` promise, and only that promise's answer may be reported
 * as an account that exists.

 * The WINDOW is sixty seconds and has not changed. The INTERVAL dropped from
 * two seconds to five hundred milliseconds on 2026/08/31, and the attempt count
 * rose by the same factor to hold the window exactly where it was: an indexer
 * query costs 102–123 ms warm (16 samples, stagenet, 2026/08/31), so a two
 * second gap was twenty times the cost of the question it asked, and the
 * overshoot — half an interval on average — was paid on a loop that is entered
 * immediately after something else already waited out the indexer's ~14 s lag.
 *
 * THE RISK, SAID PLAINLY. This loop exists so that a deployment is reported as
 * confirmed only when the chain has been seen carrying it. Shortening the
 * interval without scaling the count would have quietly narrowed the tolerance
 * for a lagging indexer from sixty seconds to fifteen, which is the one thing
 * this loop is for. When the window IS exceeded — an indexer more than a minute
 * behind — nothing is lost and nothing is invented: the deployment is recorded
 * with `ledgerConfirmed: false`, the screen says "submitted" rather than
 * "live", and the transaction id is real either way.

 * `deployContract` blocks on `publicDataProvider.watchForTxData(txId)` — see

 * stagenet that is a wait on the INDEXER, which runs 13.2–14.1 s behind the

 * claim then spent that wait before it could even ASK for the name, because the
 * name's registration is addressed to a contract address the claim did not yet
 * think it had.
 *
 * It did have it. `createUnprovenDeployTx` returns `public.contractAddress`
 * BEFORE proving, balancing, or submission — the address is
 * `new ContractDeploy(initialState).address` (midnight-js-contracts
 * `dist/index.mjs:937-944`), a pure function of the initial contract state —
 * and the whole of the local work that produces it measured 54 ms in a real
 * tab. So the address is known a full indexer-lag earlier than the claim was
 * using it, and the registration can be asked for on the strength of it.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED HERE. A submission is not a deployment. This carries no
 * `ledgerConfirmed` field at all, rather than a `false` one that a caller could
 * forget to read: the only thing that says the chain has it is {@link settled},

 * function does not retain them.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SPELLED OUT RATHER THAN LEFT TO `deployContract`
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * These are the same five steps `deployContract` runs, in the same order, from
 * the same package: `createUnprovenDeployTx` (which is where the constructor
 * runs and the address falls out), then `submitTxAsync` — which is
 * midnight-js's own name for "prove, balance, submit, and DO NOT wait" — and
 * then the watch, moved into {@link PassportContractSubmission.settled}. The
 * proving, the balancing, and the sponsorship gate are untouched: `proveTx`,
 * `walletProvider.balanceTx`, and `midnightProvider.submitTx` are called by
 * `submitTxCore` exactly as they were, so the fee is still the sponsor's and a
 * sponsor that is not ready still refuses before anything is built.
 *
 * The signing key is sampled here because `deployContract` samples it for you
 * (`createDeployTxOptions`, same module) and the address depends on it: the
 * contract's maintenance authority is part of the initial contract state that
 * the address is the hash of, so it has to be chosen before the address is
 * read, not after.
 *
 * `onProgress` is called for `deriving` and `deploying` only. `confirming`
 * belongs to whoever chooses to wait, because after this returns the waiting is
 * no longer the caller's only business — see {@link deployPassportContract},
 * which does wait and does report it.
 *
 * Every failure mode is a real one. Nothing here reports an address that did
 * not come out of the contract's own constructor, and nothing reports a
 * deployment at all — see {@link PassportContractSubmission}.
