/**
 * The Passport account-custody contract (C1) — browser edition.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 * ------------
 * One deployed instance of `account.compact` per Passport. It holds the device
 * commitment derived from this Passport's passkey, the recovery commitment, and
 * the 2-of-3 recovery shares; from there it custodies NIGHT and shielded coins
 * and carries the grant table. Deploying it is a REAL transaction on whichever
 * network the open wallet signs on — nothing here simulates a deployment.
 *
 * THE NETWORK-GENERAL PATH
 * ------------------------
 * This module takes the open {@link LocalMidnightWallet} — the passkey-derived
 * wallet — and deploys on `wallet.network.networkId`, whatever that is. A
 * localnet is not a mode: the wallet is pointed at it, so the deployment lands
 * there, by exactly the same code that reaches stagenet.
 *
 * WHERE THE CONTRACT COMES FROM (2026/08/24)
 * ------------------------------------------
 * `examples/passport-balancer/contracts-stagenet/managed/account`, staged into
 * this workspace by `scripts/prepare-zk-assets.mjs`. That is the build the
 * stagenet deployment harness used — compactc 0.33.0-rc.2, language 0.25.0,
 * runtime 0.18.0-rc.1 — and the ONLY source change from the preview contracts
 * was the pragma. It replaces the reach into
 * the repository root's `npm run compile`, whose managed output is a 0.31.1 /
 * runtime-0.16 build that the ledger-9 runtime refuses on sight:
 * `checkRuntimeVersion` is the generated module's second line.
 *
 * That reach also took the prototype's `PassportAccount` client and its
 * witness helpers with it, and those bound `@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-
 * contracts` 4.x from inside the prototype's own tree. The deploy is expressed
 * here instead, against midnight-js 5, in the eleven lines it actually takes.
 * Only the Shamir split is still imported from the prototype — it is byte-wise
 * GF(256) arithmetic with no dependency on any SDK, and duplicating a secret
 * sharing implementation to avoid one import would be the worse trade.
 *
 * All the ledger-9 plumbing — providers, the sponsored/local balancing pair,
 * the ZK config provider, transaction-id resolution — lives in
 * `./contractRuntime.ts`, shared with `./midnames.ts` and `./accountCustody.ts`.
 * The six API differences that mattered are documented there.
 *
 * NETWORK ID: like `./midnames.ts`, this module never calls `setNetworkId`. The
 * live wallet owns the process-wide network id, and moving it would corrupt
 * every address the wallet then encodes.
 *
 * HONESTY: no code path here reports a deployment that did not come back from
 * the chain. The contract address is read from the deploy transaction's own
 * response and from nowhere else, and `ledgerConfirmed` is only true when the
 * indexer was afterwards seen serving state at that address.
