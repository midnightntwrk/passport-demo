/**
 * The Passport account-custody contract (C1) — browser edition.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 * ------------
 * One deployed instance of `account.compact` per Passport. It holds the device
 * commitment derived from this Passport's passkey, the recovery commitment, and
 * the 2-of-3 recovery shares; from there it custodies NIGHT and shielded coins
 * and carries the grant table. Deploying it is a REAL transaction on whichever
 * network the open wallet signs on — nothing here simulates a deployment.
 *
 * THE NETWORK-GENERAL PATH
 * ------------------------
 * This module takes the open {@link LocalMidnightWallet} — the passkey-derived
 * wallet — and deploys on `wallet.network.networkId`, whatever that is. A
 * localnet is not a mode: the wallet is pointed at it, so the deployment lands
 * there, by exactly the same code that reaches stagenet.
 *
 * WHERE THE CONTRACT COMES FROM (2026/08/24)
 * ------------------------------------------
 * `examples/passport-balancer/contracts-stagenet/managed/account`, staged into
 * this workspace by `scripts/prepare-zk-assets.mjs`. That is the build the
 * stagenet deployment harness used — compactc 0.34.0, language 0.26.0,
 * runtime 0.19.0 since 2026/09/10, and every verifier key it produces for a
 * circuit that already existed is `cmp` identical to the 0.33.0-rc.2 keys the
 * deployed contracts carry. It replaces the reach into
 * `experiments/account-custody-prototype`, whose managed output is a 0.31.1 /
 * runtime-0.16 build that the ledger-9 runtime refuses on sight:
 * `checkRuntimeVersion` is the generated module's second line.
 *
 * That reach also took the prototype's `PassportAccount` client and its
 * witness helpers with it, and those bound `@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-
 * contracts` 4.x from inside the prototype's own tree. The deploy is expressed
 * here instead, against midnight-js 5, in the eleven lines it actually takes.
 * Only the Shamir split is still imported from the prototype — it is byte-wise
 * GF(256) arithmetic with no dependency on any SDK, and duplicating a secret
 * sharing implementation to avoid one import would be the worse trade.
 *
 * All the ledger-9 plumbing — providers, the sponsored/local balancing pair,
 * the ZK config provider, transaction-id resolution — lives in
 * `./contractRuntime.ts`, shared with `./midnames.ts` and `./accountCustody.ts`.
 * The six API differences that mattered are documented there.
 *
 * NETWORK ID: like `./midnames.ts`, this module never calls `setNetworkId`. The
 * live wallet owns the process-wide network id, and moving it would corrupt
 * every address the wallet then encodes.
 *
 * HONESTY: no code path here reports a DEPLOYMENT that did not come back from
 * the chain, and `ledgerConfirmed` is only true when the indexer was seen
 * serving state at that address.
 *
 * Since 2026/08/31 there is a second, weaker thing this module can report, and
 * it is deliberately a different type with a different name. A SUBMISSION —
 * {@link PassportContractSubmission} — carries the contract address before the
 * chain has been asked, because the address is a pure function of the initial
 * contract state the constructor just produced and is therefore known the
 * moment the transaction is built rather than the moment it lands. It has no
 * `ledgerConfirmed` field at all, so it cannot be mistaken for a deployment; it
 * carries a `settled` promise, and only that promise's answer may be reported
 * as an account that exists.

 * query costs 102–123 ms warm (16 samples, stagenet, 2026/08/31), so a two

 * claim then spent that wait before it could even ASK for the name, because the
 * name's registration is addressed to a contract address the claim did not yet
 * think it had.
 *
 * It did have it. `createUnprovenDeployTx` returns `public.contractAddress`
 * BEFORE proving, balancing, or submission — the address is
 * `new ContractDeploy(initialState).address` (midnight-js-contracts
 * `dist/index.mjs:937-944`), a pure function of the initial contract state —
 * and the whole of the local work that produces it measured 54 ms in a real
 * tab. So the address is known a full indexer-lag earlier than the claim was
 * using it, and the registration can be asked for on the strength of it.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED HERE. A submission is not a deployment. This carries no

 * them what they hold would only invite a step that does not exist.
 *
 * WHY IT WAITS, AND WHAT IT COST NOT TO
 * -------------------------------------
 * Until 2026/09/02 this asked the sponsor ONCE and refused on the answer. That
 * is wrong about what the answer means. The sponsor reserves its DUST against
 * every transaction it is balancing, so `available: 0` is a statement about the
 * next minute rather than about the day — `lib/sponsor.ts` has called `busy`
 * the transient state since 2026/08/25, and the deployed balancer sits in it
 * for two to four minutes after each spend while its wallet catches up.
 *
 * Measured on the deployed balancer that day: a second Passport claimed twenty
 * seconds after a first was refused HERE, in about two seconds, three times out
 * of three — before a prover ran, before an authenticator was touched, and
 * while the sponsor was perfectly capable of paying by the time the refusal
 * finished painting. A pair of Passports is the demo, so a gate that cannot
 * survive one is not a gate, it is the bug.
 *
 * So the sponsor is WATCHED for {@link FEE_WAIT_WINDOW_MS} rather than sampled,
 * every {@link FEE_WAIT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS}, and the wait is published to the
 * stepper (`lib/claimSteps.ts`) so the reader sees "Waiting for the fee
 * sponsor" with the seconds counting instead of a refusal about a number that
 * had already stopped being true. The window is three minutes because the
 * measured wedge is two to four and self-repairs in about ten seconds once the
 * sponsor's own sync lands; a window shorter than the fault it is for would
 * only refuse more slowly.
 *
 * WHAT IT STILL REFUSES, AND IMMEDIATELY
 * --------------------------------------
 * A build with no sponsor configured at all. Nothing about that clears with
 * time, and three minutes of a counting timer before saying so would be a lie
 * told slowly. Every other non-ready answer — `busy`, and `unreachable`, which
 * `lib/sponsor.ts` only reports after two failed probes of its own — is waited
 * out, because both are states the deployed service demonstrably comes back
 * from and neither is something the user could act on if they were told.
 *
 * Every probe after the first passes `force`, so the answer is the sponsor's
 * and not `sponsorReadiness`'s thirty-second cache: a watcher reading a cache
 * would tell somebody to keep waiting for half the time they were already free.
 *
 * Exposed separately from {@link deployPassportContract} so a re-run can fail
 * closed with the honest reason before asking the user to touch their

 * `rootSecret` is 32 bytes the caller obtained from the passkey with ONE
 * user-verified WebAuthn assertion — that assertion IS this transaction's

 * function does not retain them.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SPELLED OUT RATHER THAN LEFT TO `deployContract`
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * These are the same five steps `deployContract` runs, in the same order, from
 * the same package: `createUnprovenDeployTx` (which is where the constructor
 * runs and the address falls out), then `submitTxAsync` — which is
 * midnight-js's own name for "prove, balance, submit, and DO NOT wait" — and
 * then the watch, moved into {@link PassportContractSubmission.settled}. The
 * proving, the balancing, and the sponsorship gate are untouched: `proveTx`,
 * `walletProvider.balanceTx`, and `midnightProvider.submitTx` are called by
 * `submitTxCore` exactly as they were, so the fee is still the sponsor's and a
 * sponsor that is not ready still refuses before anything is built.
 *
 * The signing key is sampled here because `deployContract` samples it for you
 * (`createDeployTxOptions`, same module) and the address depends on it: the
 * contract's maintenance authority is part of the initial contract state that
 * the address is the hash of, so it has to be chosen before the address is
 * read, not after.
 *
 * `onProgress` is called for `deriving` and `deploying` only. `confirming`
 * belongs to whoever chooses to wait, because after this returns the waiting is
 * no longer the caller's only business — see {@link deployPassportContract},
 * which does wait and does report it.
 *
 * Every failure mode is a real one. Nothing here reports an address that did
 * not come out of the contract's own constructor, and nothing reports a
 * deployment at all — see {@link PassportContractSubmission}.

       public ledger state as `recovery_shares`. Until 2026/09/01 this code put
       real 2-of-3 Shamir shares of the recovery secret there — and since the
       `recover` circuit is live in the deployed contract and its prover key is
       served by this app, anyone who read two shares off the indexer could
       reconstruct the secret, revoke the owner's device, and take the account.
       Every account deployed with real shares is to be treated as
       compromised; on stagenet that is test value only, but it is exactly the
       class of mistake this project has been told not to make.

       Nothing in this application calls `recover` (verified: zero call sites).
       So the slots now hold three independent random values that reconstruct
       nothing, whichever two are combined. The recovery COMMITMENT is still
       derived from the real secret, which only the passkey can re-derive
       (`derivePassportContractSecrets`), so a future recovery scheme keyed on
       that secret stays possible — it will need a contract change to carry
