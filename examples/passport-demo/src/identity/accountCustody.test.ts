/**
 * Drills for the account-custody client module's decision-free parts.
 *
 * WHAT IS DRILLED, AND WHY THESE
 * ------------------------------
 * Everything in `./accountCustody.ts` that moves money needs a wallet, a proof
 * server, and a chain, and is drilled against a real network rather than mocked
 * here — a mocked withdrawal proves nothing about a withdrawal. What IS drilled
 * here is the part that is wrong silently:
 *
 *   1. the byte helpers, because a colour, a recipient address, or a coin
 *      public key that is off by a byte produces a transaction that succeeds
 *      and sends the money somewhere else; and
 *   2. `decodeAccountState`, because a balance read from the wrong ledger map,
 *      or a `Field` key rendered the wrong way round, is a number on the Home
 *      screen that nobody can tell is false.
 *
 * The decoder is drilled against a REAL ledger, not a hand-written fixture: the
 * test executes the compiled contract's own constructor and two of its circuits
 * and decodes the state that comes out, so what passes here is what the indexer
 * would serve. No ZK artefacts are involved — circuit EXECUTION is separate
 * from proving, and only proving needs the keys.
 *
 * THE TWO-RUNTIME SEAM, AND WHY THE FIXTURE BYPASSES VITE
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * There are two installed copies of `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime` in this
 * workspace: the root one, and the demo workspace's own nested copy.
 * They are the same version and structurally identical, and objects still do
 * not cross between them — a `ContractState` minted by one is refused by the
 * other's `coerceToChargedState` with "has unexpected type".
 *
 * Which copy a module gets depends on WHO resolved the specifier, and under
 * vitest that is not one answer:
 *
 *   - the compiled contract lives outside `node_modules`, so vitest INLINES it
 *     and Vite resolves its `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime` import. Run from
 *     `examples/passport-demo`, `vite.config.ts` is picked up and its
 *     `resolve.dedupe` list collapses that to the ROOT copy; run from the
 *     workspace root there is no config, no dedupe, and it resolves to the
 *     PROTOTYPE copy;
 *   - anything inside `node_modules` is externalised and resolved by NODE,
 *     which always walks up from the importer and is indifferent to both.
 *
 * So a fixture that resolves the runtime itself matches the contract in one
 * working directory and mismatches it in the other — which is exactly the
 * flake this file used to have (measured 2026/08/24: green from the workspace
 * root, `CompactError … has unexpected type` from `examples/passport-demo`).
 *
 * The fix is to take Vite out of the fixture entirely. Both halves are loaded
 * through NODE's own resolver, anchored at the contract module's own resolved
 * path: `require(contractPath)` makes Node resolve that module's runtime import
 * from the prototype's directory, and `createRequire(contractPath)` asks Node
 * the identical question. One resolver, one importer directory, one answer —
 * in any working directory, under any Vite config.
 *
 * This is sound because {@link decodeAccountState} is a pure projection: it
 * iterates a decoded ledger and reads fields, and never touches a runtime. The
 * fixture has to be internally consistent with ITSELF; it does not have to
 * share an instance with the module under test. (The module under test does
 * have to be internally consistent, and is: `vite.config.ts`'s `dedupe` gives
 * the browser bundle one copy, which is the case that ships.)
 *
 * The fixture anchors on the staged `contracts/stagenet/account/index.js` —
 * the same specifier `./accountCustody.ts` itself imports, staged from the
 * balancer's own build. It used to name a re-export living beside a sibling
 * prototype; after the migration that path resolved to another project's
 * contract, which this repository does not build, so the type came from a
 * module the app never loads.
 *
 * Runs identically from the workspace root and from `examples/passport-demo`:
 * `npx vitest run src/identity/accountCustody.test.ts`.
