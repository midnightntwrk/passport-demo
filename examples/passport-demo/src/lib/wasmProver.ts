// In-browser (zkir-v2 wasm) proving for the Passport demo.
//
// Ported from `app/src/lib/wasmProver.ts` at the repository root
// with one deliberate change: the prototype's `txTracker` import is gone, and
// the prove-busy signal is a local emitter (`onProving`) so this module has no
// dependency on any UI state container.
//
// The wasm prover runs in a dedicated worker (`./proofWorker.ts`) so the UI
// stays live during the seconds-to-tens-of-seconds a PLONK proof takes; this
// module owns key resolution on the main thread and proxies it to the worker
// per request — the same split the wallet SDK's own WasmProver uses. Key
// material for contract circuits resolves through the SAME
// FetchZkConfigProvider the HTTP path uses; system (balancing) circuits and
// SRS slices are served from `/zk-params`, byte-identical to the files the
// proof server downloads and verifies from the public bucket.
//
// Selected with `?prover=browser` or `VITE_BROWSER_PROVER=1`, and now also
// whenever no proof server is configured — which is the stagenet default,
// because stagenet publishes none (see `./localWallet.ts`). With this prover in
// play, no proof server is contacted anywhere in the stack. If the `/zk-params`
// tree has not been staged, the fetch below fails with an explicit instruction
// and that failure reaches the caller unmasked — there is no silent fallback to
// a remote proof server, because "the proof was computed locally" must never be
// claimed falsely.
//
// LEDGER-9: only the `CostModel` import moved (to `@midnightntwrk/ledger-v9`,
// the hyphenless scope). The key layout below did not, and that is not luck:
// `SYSTEM_KEYS` already names the version-9 circuits (`zswap/9/spend`,
// `dust/9/spend`, …) from the same bucket the beta SDK's own
// `makeDefaultKeyMaterialProvider` reads, so the tree
// `scripts/fetch-zk-params.mjs` stages is byte-for-byte the one ledger-9 wants.
//
// This module — rather than the SDK's `makeWasmProvingService` — is what proves
// in the browser, and that is a build constraint rather than a preference. The
// SDK's prover starts its worker with
// `new Worker(new URL(`../../dist/proof-worker.js`, currentFile))` from inside
// `node_modules`: a template literal against a variable, which Vite's worker
// analysis does not rewrite, so the worker's own bare imports (`effect`,
// `@midnight-ntwrk/zkir-v2`) reach the browser unresolved. The `new
// Worker(new URL('./proofWorker.ts', import.meta.url), …)` below is the form
// Vite does rewrite. The SDK's service is used under Node instead, where the
// same code path works and no staging is needed.

/**
 * How long a request may go without a WORD from the worker before the worker
 * is presumed dead — and why there are two of these rather than one.
 *
 * It is an IDLE bound, not a total one. A first shielded send legitimately
 * takes minutes, but almost none of that is silent: roughly 54 MB of proving
 * keys comes down first, and every one of them arrives as a `km` request on
 * this channel, so the download restarts the clock over and over.
 *
 * THE SILENT STRETCH IS THE PROOF ITSELF, and it is silent by construction.
 * Once the wasm has every key it needs it runs synchronous PLONK arithmetic
 * inside the worker with nothing to report until it is finished — no
 * progress messages, no yields, no way for this side to tell "still working"
 * from "gone". So the bound has to be long enough to cover the whole of that
 * stretch on the slowest device Passport runs on, and a shielded leg on an
 * iPhone can plausibly take several minutes. A bound that is merely generous
 * for a laptop restarts a proof that was going to succeed, doubles the wait,
 * and then fails it — strictly worse than the hang it replaced.
 *
 * `check` has no such stretch: it is a validation pass, and 90 seconds of
 * silence from one is already a dead worker.
 *
 * The elapsed time of every request is logged by the worker
 * (`proofWorker.ts`), so these two numbers can be replaced by measurements
 * from real devices rather than left as estimates.
 *
 * WHAT THEY ARE FOR. iOS reclaims memory by killing the WebContent process or
 * jettisoning a worker outright, and neither produces an `error` event: the
 * worker simply stops answering. `callWorker` had no timeout, no signal, and
 * no cancellation, so a proof interrupted by the user switching apps left a
 * spinner that never resolved — for ever, on the send screen, after the money
 * may already have moved.
