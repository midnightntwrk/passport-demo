/**
 * Per-network public endpoints, and the one network THIS BUILD's wallet runs
 * on.
 *
 * Before 2026/08/06 the demo was pinned to Preview in a dozen places: a
 * hard-coded faucet URL, a hard-coded explorer origin, and `=== 'preview'`
 * gates in the claim path. Pointing the deployment at Pre-production meant the
 * wallet moved but the UI kept saying "preview only" and linking at the
 * Preview faucet — which would have been a lie in exactly the places this demo
 * is meant to be honest.
 *
 * So there is now one module that answers three questions:
 *
 *   1. Which network did this build's `VITE_MIDNIGHT_NETWORK_ID` select?
 *      That is where the wallet signs, and therefore the only network a name
 *      can be registered on from here.
 *   2. Does a given network have a public faucet, and at what URL?
 *   3. Does it have a public explorer, and what does a transaction link look
 *      like there?
 *
 * Nothing here invents an endpoint. A network with no entry gets `null`, and
 * every caller renders that as "no link" rather than a link that goes nowhere.
 *
 * WHAT THE LEDGER-9 MOVE DID TO THIS TABLE (2026/08/24)
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * Stagenet is the default, and it is the only network this build can transact
 * on. That is not a preference — it is what the stack allows.
 *
 * The app now runs on `@midnightntwrk/ledger-v9` 1.0.0-rc.3 and midnight-js
 * 5.0.0-beta.6, because the ledger-8 stack cannot sync stagenet at all: its
 * indexer client fails parsing the stagenet schema before the first block is
 * applied. The move is not reversible per network. Preview and Pre-production
 * run the ledger-8 protocol, and a ledger-9 wallet cannot decode their
 * transactions or produce ones they will accept — a single build cannot serve
 * both, because the ledger is a WASM module compiled against one protocol.
 *
 * Preview and Pre-production therefore remain KNOWN networks — records already
 * stored against them still render, and their explorer links still resolve —
 * but they are not selectable, not claimable, and not something this build's
 * wallet can open. {@link TRANSACTABLE_NETWORKS} is the honest list, and
 * {@link networkUnavailableReason} is the sentence to show instead of a
 * pretence that switching would work.
 *
 * This module imports nothing from the app, so anything may import it.
