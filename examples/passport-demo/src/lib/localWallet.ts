/**
 * Passkey-derived, in-browser Midnight wallet.
 *
 * This is a straight port of the working account-custody prototype path
 * (`app/src/lib/providers.ts` at the repository root,
 * `deriveKeys` + `createWallet`) into the Passport demo, with three deliberate
 * differences:
 *
 *   1. The seed comes from the Passport passkey's WebAuthn PRF output, not from
 *      a hard-coded genesis seed. There is no `GENESIS_SEED` here and there
 *      never should be — this module must be safe to point at Preview.
 *   2. Every network endpoint is configurable through `import.meta.env`, with
 *      Preview as the default rather than a localnet.
 *   3. The returned handle reports the surfaces the Home screen reads
 *      (see `LocalWalletSurfaces` below).
 *
 * Proving defaults to an HTTP proof server. The prototype's `?prover=browser`
 * in-tab zkir-v2 path is now ported as well (see `./wasmProver.ts`): it needs a
 * staged `/zk-params` asset tree, produced by `scripts/fetch-zk-params.mjs`.
 * When those assets are absent the browser prover fails loudly — it never
 * quietly falls back to the remote proof server, because a demo must not claim
 * local proving it did not do.
 *
 * ONE TRANSACTION, AND NO SEND API (2026/08/25)
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * This wallet originates exactly one transaction in its life: the deploy of
 * this Passport's account-custody contract. Everything else that moves value —
 * a withdrawal, a dApp payment, a deposit — is a circuit on that contract, and
 * the account is the user's identity. So there is no `sendUnshieldedNight` and
 * no `sendShieldedToken` here; the transfer primitives were deleted rather than
 * left dormant, because latent code that moves the wallet's own money is a
 * second way to spend that nothing in the product asks for. What survives is
 * what the deploy and the account circuits genuinely need: the facade, the
 * keystore, the balances, and the advisory {@link FeeReadiness} probe.
 *
 * Sync state is cached (see `./walletSnapshot.ts`) so a second session resumes
 * the chain walk from the last applied index instead of replaying it from zero.
 * A snapshot the SDK refuses is discarded and the wallet cold-starts;
 * `resumedFromSnapshot` reports which of the two actually happened.
 *
 * HOW A WALLET GETS ITS FIRST CHAIN POSITION (2026/08/06)
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * Two ways, and the handle says which happened:
 *
 *   1. `resumedFromSnapshot` — a cached snapshot for this (network, address)
 *      was accepted, so the walk continues from where it stopped.
 *   2. Otherwise, a walk from genesis — but only where one can finish. Above
 *      {@link DEEP_CHAIN_BLOCK_THRESHOLD} blocks it is refused outright with a
 *      {@link WalletBootstrapError} rather than started, because in a browser
 *      tab it does not finish: measured on Pre-production (~1.98M blocks) the
 *      heap climbs ~25 MB/s and the tab dies at ~4.2 GB. Refusing is honest;
 *      crashing is not.
 *
 * There is deliberately no third way. Starting a brand-new wallet at the chain
 * tip was implemented and measured on 2026/08/06 and does not work — the
 * ledger's zswap and DUST commitment trees must be filled from genesis in
 * index order, and no public indexer endpoint can fast-forward them. The
 * evidence, and the code that would do it if that ever changes, is in the
 * tip-bootstrap section of `./walletSnapshot.ts`. Nothing here calls it.
 *
 * THE LEDGER-9 PORT (2026/08/24)
 * -----------------------------
 * This module now runs on `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk` 2.0.0-beta.2 over
 * `@midnightntwrk/ledger-v9`, because the ledger-8 stack cannot sync stagenet
 * at all — its indexer schema parse fails before the first block. The shape of
 * everything below is unchanged; five details are not.
 *
 *   1. **The ledger is the HYPHENLESS scope.** `@midnightntwrk/ledger-v9`, not
 *      `@midnight-ntwrk/ledger-v9`. Two different WASM modules.
 *   2. **Everything comes through the `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk` umbrella.**
 *      Not for tidiness: this workspace still carries the LEDGER-8
 *      `wallet-sdk-facade`, `wallet-sdk-shielded`, and friends for
 *      `examples/passport-funder`, and they are the copies hoisted to the
 *      repository root. A bare `import … from '@midnight-ntwrk/
 *      wallet-sdk-facade'` here resolves to the ledger-8 one and hands this
 *      wallet objects from a foreign ledger instance. The umbrella's subpaths
 *      resolve inside its own nested tree, which is the ledger-9 one.
 *   3. **The keystore takes a tagged secret**: `createKeystore({ kind:
 *      'schnorr', secret }, networkId)`. Role numbers are unchanged, so a seed
 *      derives the same address it did on ledger-8.
 *   4. **Signing is async.** `signRecipe` takes `(data) => Promise<Signature>`;
 *      the keystore ships `signDataAsync` for exactly that call site.
 *   5. **Transaction history is an interface, not a stub.** The old
 *      `{ upsert, getAll, get, serialize }` object is now
 *      `NoOpTransactionHistoryStorage`.
