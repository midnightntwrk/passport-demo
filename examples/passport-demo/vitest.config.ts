/**
 * The unit-test configuration, and — more importantly — the written record of
 * WHICH of this app's own logic is held to a coverage bar and which is not.
 *
 * It merges `vite.config.ts` rather than replacing it. That is not tidiness:
 * the `resolve.dedupe` list there is what collapses `@midnight-ntwrk/
 * compact-runtime` onto ONE copy, and two copies are two `ChargedState`
 * classes and a decode that fails `instanceof` on correct objects. A vitest
 * config that dropped it would make `accountCustody.test.ts` fail in a way
 * that looks like a decoder bug.
 *
 * THE COVERAGE DENOMINATOR
 * ------------------------
 * `coverage.include` is an explicit allow-list, and the threshold on it is
 * 100% of statements, branches, functions, and lines. A percentage is only
 * worth reading if the thing it is a percentage OF is stated, so every module
 * that is NOT in it is named below with the reason. There are no silent
 * exclusions and no wildcards standing in for a decision.
 *
 * WHAT IS OUT, AND WHY — `src/lib`
 * --------------------------------
 * `src/lib/accountOnPasskey.ts` went IN on 2026/08/31, the day it was written,
 * and it is in the denominator because it decides whether somebody is asked to
 * touch an authenticator. It is the rule that replaced a blob write fired at
 * the end of a name claim — a whole user-verified assertion, which arrived as
 * a passkey prompt sitting on top of a finished Home screen that the reader
 * had pressed nothing to summon. Every branch in it is either a way of asking
 * for a ceremony nobody wanted or a way of silently never writing at all, and
 * both have been met. It holds no DOM, no React, no storage, and no WebAuthn:
 * a profile in, a decision out, drilled directly in
 * `src/lib/accountOnPasskey.test.ts`.
 *
 * `src/lib/addressSendPolicy.ts` went IN on 2026/09/18, the day it was written,
 * and it is in the denominator because it is the only thing standing between a
 * Passport and an account it can never spend from again. The account build every
 * Passport is on today splits a shielded coin when it is asked for part of one,
 * and the remainder it puts back is refused by the node for ever after — so one
 * partial payment to a raw address costs that Passport every later shielded
 * send, its `.night` name payments included. This module is the rule that
 * refuses exactly that shape and NOTHING else, which is the half that needs the
 * drilling: a branch too many here takes away a send that works — NIGHT, a name,
 * a whole coin — and a branch too few lets the account be broken. It holds no
 * DOM, no React, no network, and no clock: an asset, a recipient, a build, an
 * amount, and a holding in; a sentence or `null` out. Every combination of the
 * four is drilled in `src/lib/addressSendPolicy.test.ts`, and the sentence is
 * asserted there too, because it is what somebody mid-payment is left holding.
 *
 * `src/lib/appBusy.ts` went IN on 2026/08/26, the day it was written. It is the
 * counter that answers "is Passport in the middle of something?" for the
 * service-worker update path in `src/pwa.tsx`, and getting that answer wrong in
 * either direction is a user-visible failure: too eager and a reload lands
 * inside a proving run, too cautious and an installed client never picks up a
 * deployment. It holds no DOM, no React, and no timers — it is a counter, a
 * listener set, and the rule that a release only counts once — so every one of
 * those branches is drilled directly in `src/lib/appBusy.test.ts`.
 *
 * `src/lib/balanceWatch.ts` went IN on 2026/09/03, the day it was written. It
 * decides WHEN this app reads the account's ledger again, and the defect it was
 * written for is a reviewer watching an opening balance sit at zero until they
 * reloaded the page themselves — with the recipient of a transfer seeing the
 * same thing from the other side. Every branch in it is a way of lying about
 * somebody's money by omission: a chase that never starts leaves the figure
 * stale, one that never ends turns a Passport left open into a load generator,
 * one that mistakes a failed read for an arrival stops early, and one that runs
 * in a backgrounded tab is a schedule the browser will throttle into
 * dishonesty. It holds no DOM, no React, no `fetch`, and no clock of its own —
 * the timers and the clock are injected — so all of it is drilled on a
 * hand-wound clock in `src/lib/balanceWatch.test.ts`. Its React wiring is
 * `src/screens/useBalanceWatch.ts`, which is out for the same reason every
 * other module in `src/screens` is: it imports React, and there is no jsdom
 * here to render a hook into. That file holds the watch's lifetime, a
 * `visibilitychange` listener, and two refs — no decisions.
 *
 * `src/lib/buildId.ts` went IN on 2026/09/14, the day it was written. It is
 * one string rewrite, and that rewrite is the whole of the repair for a
 * reviewer who could not create a Passport at all: `/zk/**` is served with a
 * year-long `immutable` on urls that carry no content hash, so a browser
 * holding the previous contract manifest refused the new build's verifier keys
 * against it and setup stopped dead. Every branch in it is a way of getting a
 * cache key wrong — an id that never arrives leaves the stale entry in play, a
 * query that is overwritten loses whatever the caller put there, an id appended
 * twice makes two addresses out of one build, and an id appended after a
 * fragment is not in the query at all. It holds no DOM, no React, no `fetch`,
 * and above all NO `window` — the same code runs under the Node drill
 * harness, which must not be given one — so all of it is drilled directly in
 * `src/lib/buildId.test.ts`, in this file's default `node` environment, which
 * is itself the windowless condition being asserted.
 *
 * `src/lib/chainWait.ts` went IN on 2026/09/07, the day it was written. It
 * holds the bound on every wait this app makes on the chain, and the defect it
 * was written for is a reviewer left on "Setting up your account…" for ever
 * while their transaction sat happily in a block. Every branch in it is a way
 * of getting a wait wrong: one that never ends is the defect itself, one that
 * ends too early reports an account nobody has confirmed, one that swallows a
 * refusal hides a transaction the chain threw out, and one that abandons a
 * promise without handling its rejection turns a slow node into a console
 * error minutes later. It holds no SDK, no DOM, no `fetch`, and no clock of
 * its own — the clock and the sleep are injected — so all of it is drilled on
 * a hand-wound clock in `src/lib/chainWait.test.ts`. The SDK shapes it is used
 * against stay in `src/identity/contractRuntime.ts` and
 * `src/identity/passportContract.ts`, which are out for the reason every
 * module in that directory is.
 *
 * `src/lib/nodeSubmission.ts` went IN on 2026/09/23, the day it was written.
 * It is the wallet's submission service, and the defect it was written for is
 * a second new Passport in one browser failing every press on staging: the
 * SDK's node client asked its socket to close and then submitted on it before
 * the close had finished. Every branch in it is a way a submission meets a
 * close — the opening one, another submission's, two at once, one that never
 * finishes — and each is drilled in `src/lib/nodeSubmission.test.ts` against a
 * fake that closes the way polkadot-js does. The SDK glue that opens the real
 * client stays in `src/lib/localWallet.ts`, which is out below.
 *
 * `src/lib/sheetHistory.ts` went IN on 2026/09/04, the day it was written. It
 * decides which history entry belongs to which of Passport's sheets, and
 * whether a closing sheet still owes the stack an entry — three answers, and
 * each of the wrong ones is a way of taking somebody out of the app. A mark it
 * read too loosely closes a sheet on a `popstate` that belonged to somebody
 * else; an entry it unwound after the back gesture had already popped it
 * navigates the document away, which is the defect it was written for arrived
 * at from the other side; an entry it failed to unwind is a back press the
 * reader makes and sees nothing happen to. It holds no DOM and no React — the
 * `pushState`, the listener, and the lifetime are all in
 * `src/screens/useSheetBackButton.ts`, which stays out with the rest of
 * `src/screens` because it imports React and there is no jsdom here to render
 * a hook into. That file holds no decisions.
 *
 * `src/lib/zkArtefactCache.ts` went IN on 2026/09/03, the day it was written,
 * and it is in the denominator because it is a RULE about somebody's memory
 * budget, measured rather than guessed. midnight-js asks a ZK config provider
 * for a circuit's artefacts three times per contract call — `lookupKey`,
 * `check` (whose payload uses the IR alone and discards the prover key), and
 * `prove` — and neither `ZKConfigRegistry` nor `FetchZkConfigProvider` holds
 * the bytes between them. For `withdraw_shielded` that is 19.5 MB a time, and
 * one mUSD send to a name is two such legs: six downloads and six SHA-256
 * integrity passes, 117 MB, for a transaction that needs 39 MB. Measured live
 * on stagenet against bf5a527 the same day, that is the whole of the renderer's
 * memory profile — 330 MB at rest, 711 MB across leg one's artefact reads,
 * 787 MB across leg two's — and it is the window a headless browser running two
 * Passports died in at 16:30:46 UTC.
 *
 * Every way this module can be wrong is a way of making that worse or of
 * breaking a proof: an artefact served for the wrong circuit proves the wrong
 * thing; a remembered REJECTION makes one bad moment on the network permanent
 * for the life of the tab; a memo that never releases trades a peak for a
 * resting 39 MB that never comes back; and a wrapper that reimplemented
 * midnight-js's `get` and `getVerifierKeys` instead of inheriting them is a
 * second copy of somebody else's composition rules, waiting to drift. All four
 * are drilled, the last against a provider carrying those compositions on its
 * prototype. It holds no DOM, no React, no `fetch`, and no clock of its own —
 * the provider and the clock are injected — so all of it is drilled directly in
 * `src/lib/zkArtefactCache.test.ts`. The `FetchZkConfigProvider` it wraps, and
 * the one place it is wrapped, stay out in `src/identity/contractRuntime.ts`
 * with the rest of the midnight-js plumbing.
 *
 * `src/lib/installPrompt.ts` went IN on 2026/09/03, the day it was written. It
 * decides whether a person is offered a way to install Passport and which of
 * the two offers they get, and it exists because a reviewer running the app in
 * an ordinary browser tab could find no way to install it at all. Both ways of
 * getting it wrong are user-visible and opposite: offering nothing to somebody
 * who could install, or offering a button on iOS Safari — which fires no
 * install event and never will — that could only do nothing when pressed. The
 * "already installed" test is two questions rather than one for the same
 * reason, since iOS answers only its own. It reads a plain object rather than
 * `window`, so every rule is drilled against real user-agent strings in
 * `src/lib/installPrompt.test.ts`. The control that renders its answer,
 * `src/screens/InstallPassport.tsx`, stays out with the rest of the `.tsx`.
 *
 * `src/identity/claimWarmup.ts` went IN on 2026/08/26, the day it was written,
 * and it belongs in the denominator more than most: it is the module that
 * decides whether a claim may REUSE an answer to "is this name still free" and
 * "will the service register it" instead of asking again. Getting that wrong is
 * not a slow screen, it is a claim that proceeds to a passkey prompt and an
 * account deploy on a stale "available" — the exact refusal the pre-checks
 * exist to make before the ceremony. Every rule that makes reuse safe is a
 * branch in this file: the key is the name AND the network, the TTL expiry
 * forces a re-probe, a non-answer is never cached, a rejection is never cached,
 * and a refusal is handed back as the refusal it was. It holds no DOM, no
 * React, no `fetch` and no clock of its own — the probes and the clock are
 * injected — so all of it is drilled directly on a fake clock in
 * `src/identity/claimWarmup.test.ts`.
 *
 * `src/lib/claimSteps.ts` went IN on 2026/08/30, the day it was written, and it
 * is in the denominator for the same reason `claimWarmup.ts` is: it is a RULE,
 * not a rendering. It decides which of the three steps a person is told they
 * are on for each of the claim's seven phases, and the ways it can be wrong are
 * all ways of lying to somebody who is waiting — ticking a step that has not
 * happened, leaving one un-ticked behind the running one, or skipping the
 * passkey prompt's own step so the one moment that needs the user's hand goes
 * unannounced. It holds no DOM, no React, no clock, and no I/O: a phase in,
 * three labelled states out, so every phase and every ordering invariant is
 * drilled directly in `src/lib/claimSteps.test.ts`. The JSX that paints circles
 * and lines from its answer stays out with the rest of the `.tsx`.
 *
 * It grew a second job on 2026/08/31 and it belongs in the denominator for the
 * same reason: the words a waiting person is told about TIME. It holds each
 * step's expected duration, the four sub-states the long step is made of, and
 * the three sentences a timing line can be — inside the estimate, past it, or
 * waiting on the reader. Every one of those is a way of lying to somebody who
 * is waiting: an estimate said as a promise, a counter that resets when a
 * phase changes, a stage that freezes at its estimate rather than admitting it
 * has run over. The clock ITSELF — the interval, the start times, the cleanup —
 * stays in the screen, because it is a timer and not a rule; what is drilled
 * here is what the screen is allowed to say with it.
 *
 * `src/lib/claimFailure.ts` went IN on 2026/09/02, the day it was written, and
 * it is in the denominator because it is the rule that decides whether somebody
 * whose claim did not complete is offered a way on or only an explanation. It
 * exists because of a live acceptance run that night: the account was already
 * deployed, the service refused the name with a 500 during a forced blackout of
 * the read side, and the failure card said the name was being kept and then
 * stopped — no retry, and no mention of the "Register now" that was sitting on
 * Home for exactly that name. The card had been furnished for one failure only,
 * the passkey one, and bare for every other.
 *
 * Every way it can be wrong is a way of stranding somebody or of costing them
 * more than it gives them: a card with no controls at all (the reported
 * defect); BOTH pairs on one card, which is two "Try again" buttons and an
 * ambiguous control in a real browser; a retry offered with no name to claim,
 * which can only fail; and a retry offered mid-claim, which is how a second
 * passkey ceremony gets started on top of the first. It holds no DOM, no React,
 * no storage, and no clock — four facts in, a shape out — so all of it is
 * drilled directly in `src/lib/claimFailure.test.ts`. The two buttons the
 * screen paints from its answer stay out with the rest of the `.tsx`.
 *
 * `src/lib/waitingGame.ts` went IN on 2026/09/03, the day it was written, and
 * it is in the denominator for a reason that has nothing to do with the game:
 * it is the module that promises a diversion offered beside a claim can never
 * become a reason the claim goes wrong. The screen pauses the game by taking
 * its state out of `running`, and the guarantee it leans on is that a tick on
 * a state which is not running returns that same state, unadvanced — so "stop
 * the instant the passkey prompt appears" is one call rather than a race with
 * a frame loop. That property, and the frame clamp beside it, are the two
 * drills that matter: a backgrounded tab hands the loop a gap of seconds on
 * return, and a runner integrated through it lands on the far side of an
 * obstacle it never touched.
 *
 * The rest of it is in the denominator because it can be: it holds no canvas,
 * no `requestAnimationFrame`, no clock, no `Math.random`, and no keyboard. The
 * elapsed milliseconds are handed in and the obstacle sizes come from a seeded
 * generator carried in the state, so a run replays exactly and the collision
 * rule is drilled rather than eyeballed, on a hand-wound clock in
 * `src/lib/waitingGame.test.ts`. Its other half — a canvas, a frame loop, and
 * two listeners, holding no rules at all — is `src/screens/WaitingGame.tsx`,
 * out with the rest of the `.tsx`.
 *
 * `src/lib/companionLink.ts` went IN on 2026/09/03, the day it was written. It
 * is four lines of rule behind a link out to a Telegram chat, and it is in the
 * denominator because it is the only part of that control anybody can get
 * wrong. Passport does not talk to the Companion, holds nothing for it, and
 * learns nothing back — the whole of the interaction is an address opened in a
 * new tab — so the address IS the feature. Both ways of getting it wrong put a
 * reader somewhere nobody chose: ignoring a `VITE_COMPANION_URL` an operator
 * deliberately set, or forwarding a half-configured one — blank, unparseable,
 * or on a scheme no browser should follow from a link this app renders. It
 * reads a plain value rather than `import.meta.env`, so every case is drilled
 * directly in `src/lib/companionLink.test.ts`. The two shapes the control is
 * painted in, `src/screens/Companion.tsx`, stay out with the rest of the
 * `.tsx`.
 *
 * `src/lib/endpoints.ts` went IN on 2026/08/31, the day it was written, and it
 * belongs in the denominator because it is the rule that decides WHERE a
 * transaction gets proved and who pays for it. Until that day proving, fee
 * sponsorship, sponsored name registration, and activation grants all rode one
 * droplet; two of those four now take an ordered list of providers, and this is
 * the part of that which is a decision rather than a network call. Every way it
 * can be wrong is a way of making the demo LESS reliable than the single URL it
 * replaced: an order silently reshuffled would make "gateway first" untestable,
 * an endpoint dropped from the list would be a single point of failure nobody
 * knows they have, a refusal swallowed rather than carried would strip the
 * error a caller needs to tell a busy sponsor from a dead one, and — the worst
 * of them — a fallback that reported success when nothing served would claim a
 * covered fee that was never covered. It holds no `fetch`, no clock, and no
 * environment: an array in, a decision out, with the asking injected. So the
 * ordering, the skip-unready case, the fall-through-on-failure case, the
 * all-refused case, and the single-endpoint compatibility case are all drilled
 * directly in `src/lib/endpoints.test.ts`. The HTTP either side of it — the
 * `/wallet-status` probe, the `/balance-only` POST, and the proof server's
 * `/prove` — stays out with the rest of the network calls, and is drilled
 * against the real 1AM stagenet gateway and our own balancer instead.
 *
 * `src/lib/activityFeed.ts` went IN on 2026/08/30, the day it was written, and
 * it is in the denominator because it is the only place a person can go back and
 * check what happened to their own money. Every function in it is a way of
 * misleading them if it is wrong: a relative time that rounds up claims more
 * elapsed time than has elapsed; a day heading taken off the elapsed
 * milliseconds rather than the reader's own calendar files this morning's
 * transfer under "Yesterday"; a dot that flattened `blocked` into `complete`
 * would say something happened that did not; and a stored-row reader that
 * accepted a row with no label would paint an empty line with a dot beside it.
 * It holds no DOM, no React, no storage, and no clock of its own — the clock is
 * injected everywhere but the two cases that exercise the default — so all of it
 * is drilled directly in `src/lib/activityFeed.test.ts`. The `window.localStorage`
 * call between its parse and its writer is two lines in `App.tsx` and stays out
 * with the rest of the app shell.
 *
 * `src/lib/activationHold.ts` went IN on 2026/09/04, the day it was written,
 * and it is in the denominator because it is the rule that decides whether a
 * grant coin is spent. The sponsor soak of that day recorded the defect it
 * closes: a registration refused at the sponsor's hourly ceiling at 17:38:02
 * and a `/fund-account` posted for the same account a second later, which
 * succeeded — leaving a Passport holding NIGHT and a stablecoin balance with no
 * name against it, and a grant that is once per account for ever spent on it.
 * Every branch in it is a way of getting that wrong in one of the two
 * directions: a refusal code read as harmless funds a nameless account, and a
 * hold that never lifts leaves a Passport that has its name unfunded for good.
 * It holds no DOM, no React, and no clock — a code in, a decision out, and
 * three `window.localStorage` calls whose every failure mode is drilled against
 * an in-memory store in `src/lib/activationHold.test.ts`. The sequencing that
 * consults it is four lines in `App.tsx` and stays out with the rest of the app
 * shell.
 *
 * `src/lib/recipientName.ts` went IN on 2026/08/30, the day it was written. It
 * decides which of two completely different things happens to what somebody
 * typed into the recipient field — a `.night` registry read, or a bech32m
 * decode — and every way it can pick wrong is a way of showing a person the
 * wrong refusal about the wrong thing: "that is not a Midnight address" about a
 * name they typed correctly, or "no Passport has this name" about a mistyped
 * address. Its cache decides how often the registry is asked, and getting that
 * wrong is either a network read per keystroke or an answer that has gone stale
 * inside one sheet. It is regular expressions, a Map, and a string tail — no
 * DOM, no React, no network, and deliberately no import of
 * `identity/midnames.ts`, whose every import pulls the ledger in behind it — so
 * all of it is drilled directly in `src/lib/recipientName.test.ts`. The
 * debounce, the resolving state, and the confirmation chip stay out with the
 * rest of the `.tsx`.
 *
 * `src/lib/qrPayload.ts` went IN on 2026/08/31, the day Receive learned to draw
 * a code rather than only read one. It is the ONE place both directions of the
 * QR format are written down, and an encoder and a decoder that drift apart
 * produce a square Passport draws and Passport cannot read — a failure that
 * looks like a broken camera and is not. The rules it holds are all rules about
 * trust: which query parameter is honoured and which is ignored, that an
 * embedded account is kept only when it is exactly 32 bytes of hex, that an
 * all-upper scan is the same payload as a lower-case one, and that a URL or a
 * Wi-Fi config is nothing at all rather than something to act on. It is regular
 * expressions, a `URLSearchParams`, and one call into `recipientName.ts` so
 * there is a single definition of what a Passport name may be — no DOM, no
 * React, no camera, and no canvas — so every branch is drilled directly in
 * `src/lib/qrPayload.test.ts`. The camera, the image decode, and the SVG that
 * paints the answer stay out with the rest of the `.tsx`.
 *
 * `src/lib/sendAssets.ts` went IN on 2026/08/31, the day the Send sheet stopped
 * inferring what was being sent from the address it was going to. It is the
 * module that answers two questions about somebody's money: what this account
 * can send, and where each of those things is allowed to go. Both ways of
 * getting the first wrong are visible on the picker — an asset missing from a
 * list of what is held, or two options carrying the same ticker over different
 * colours, which is the wrong-send the naming work exists to prevent. Getting
 * the second wrong is worse and quieter: a refusal that does not name the asset
 * leaves somebody re-reading an address that was never the problem, and a rule
 * that accepted a mismatch would offer a send the ledger cannot make. It holds
 * no DOM, no React, no network, and no wallet SDK — the address taxonomy stays
 * in the sheet with the codec that owns it, and this only checks that answer
 * against a choice — so every entry, every ordering rule, and every sentence is
 * drilled directly in `src/lib/sendAssets.test.ts`. The picker itself, the
 * amount field it drives, and the review rows stay out with the rest of the
 * `.tsx`.
 *
 * `src/lib/shieldedNote.ts` went IN on 2026/08/31, the day it was written, and
 * it is in the denominator because getting it wrong loses somebody money
 * quietly. It decides WHICH shielded note the second leg of a Passport-to-
 * Passport transfer deposits, and the deposit takes a note WHOLE — so a wallet
 * that already held a note of the same colour and the same size offers two
 * candidates the moment the first leg lands, and picking the older one pays the
 * recipient out of money the sender had put aside and strands the note the
 * transfer produced. Every branch in it is either a way of matching on
 * resemblance instead of identity or a way of acting on a note that cannot be
 * read at all, and both are met. It holds no DOM, no React, no network, and no
 * wallet SDK — the notes are read in `identity/accountCustody.ts` and handed
 * in — so all of it is drilled directly in `src/lib/shieldedNote.test.ts`. The
 * poll that calls it, its deadline, and the transfer's two submissions stay out
 * in `App.tsx` with the rest of the app shell.
 *
 * `src/lib/passkeyRecovery.ts` went IN on 2026/08/30, the day it was written,
 * and it is in the denominator because it is the rule that decides whether a
 * person who cannot sign in is offered a way forward or only an explanation.
 * Both ways of getting it wrong are user-visible and neither is loud: too
 * cautious and the reported dead end comes straight back — records here, no
 * credential the keystore will produce, and a screen that can only describe
 * that; too eager and Passport suggests enrolling a second passkey to somebody
 * whose first one worked perfectly and whose actual failure was a decryption or
 * a chain read. It holds no DOM, no React, no WebAuthn, and deliberately no
 * import of `backend.ts` — the authenticator's reason is passed in as a string
 * — so every branch is drilled directly in `src/lib/passkeyRecovery.test.ts`.
 * The two `catch` blocks in `App.tsx` that consult it, and the panel in
 * `Onboarding.tsx` that renders its answer, stay out with the rest of the app
 * shell and the `.tsx`.
 *
 * `src/lib/passportIdentity.ts` went IN on 2026/09/08, the day it was written,
 * and it is in the denominator because both rules in it were caught being
 * wrong in production on the same morning. It decides what Passport is willing
 * to call itself to another application, and whether there is a Passport there
 * to be asked at all. Getting the first wrong shared the label the passkey was
 * enrolled under — 'Midnight Passport', the same string on nearly every device
 * — as though it were the user's own name, so an app keying anything on it
 * would key every unnamed Passport in the world onto one value. Getting the
 * second wrong armed a modal consent sheet over the Welcome screen, where its
 * backdrop covered the only action that could have finished the setup, and the
 * asking app waited out its three-minute timeout in silence. It holds no DOM,
 * no React, and no storage — records and flags in, decisions out — so every
 * branch is drilled directly in `src/lib/passportIdentity.test.ts`. The three
 * surfaces that consult it (`App.tsx`, `profileConsent.tsx`, and
 * `screens/callbackConsent.tsx`) stay out with the rest of the `.tsx`.
 *
 * `src/lib/feeReadinessPoll.ts` went IN on 2026/08/25 rather than out with the
 * screens it serves: it is the sponsor watcher, it holds no DOM and no React,
 * and its whole contract — probe now, probe again every five seconds, publish
 * every change, and send the sponsor's diagnostic to a log rather than towards
 * a screen — is drivable on a fake clock. The React that consumes it is three
 * lines of `useEffect` in `SendSheet.tsx`, which stays out with the rest of the
 * `.tsx`.
 *
 * `src/lib/feeRecheck.ts` went IN on 2026/09/08, the day it was written, and
 * for the same reasons: it is the confirm-time half of the same probe, it holds
 * no DOM and no React, and every branch in it decides whether a person who has
 * pressed Send is sent on or told the fee arrangement changed. Getting it wrong
 * in one direction refuses a healthy send — which is what it was written to
 * stop — and in the other sends somebody on an arrangement they did not
 * confirm. Its whole contract is drivable on an injected clock.
 *
 * `src/lib/oneTxProbe.ts` and `src/lib/txFailure.ts` went IN on 2026/09/15, the
 * day they were written, and both are in the denominator because both are
 * rules whose failure is invisible from inside the app.
 *
 * `oneTxProbe.ts` is the schedule that decides whether a brand-new Passport
 * sends in one step or two for the whole of its first session. It was written
 * because the previous rule — ask once, and read "could not ask" as "no" — is
 * indistinguishable from working: every send still goes through, just slower,
 * for exactly the accounts that had earned the fast path by being new. A
 * schedule that stops too early, loops forever, or answers on a guess all look
 * the same from the outside, so the clock is injected and all three are
 * drilled. It holds no React, no timers of its own, and no idea what is being
 * asked.
 *
 * `txFailure.ts` is the one place that decides what a PARTNER APP is told when
 * a payment fails, which makes its output the only string in this app that is
 * rendered by software nobody here wrote. It replaced a mapper that paired the
 * wire code with the thrown message, and so shipped "SubmissionError: 1010:
 * Invalid Transaction: Custom error: 239" to every integrating app's users. Its
 * drill holds both halves to a standard: nothing rendered may contain the
 * machinery, and every wire code must be the one that was on the wire before,
 * because a copy fix that quietly re-coded failures is a breaking change in
 * disguise. A cause in, a reply out — no DOM, no React, no wallet.
 * `src/lib/dynamicSession.ts` went IN on 2026/09/14, the day it was written.
 * It is the gate the whole social sign-in slice hangs off — `isDynamicEnabled`
 * decides whether an SDK that once cost this app 5.7 MB of entry chunk is
 * fetched at all — plus the pure mapping from Dynamic's user object to the two
 * strings a screen renders. It holds no DOM, no React, no network, and no SDK
 * import, so every branch is reachable from a plain object in
 * `dynamicSession.test.ts`. Its React half is next, and it is out:
 *
 * `src/lib/dynamic.tsx` is OUT, on the `.tsx` rule that keeps every other
 * component out. It is the SDK's two `import()` calls, a bridge component, and
 * a `useSyncExternalStore` wrapper; exercising any of it needs a DOM this
 * workspace deliberately does not have, and there is no decision in it — the
 * one computation it performs is `describeDynamicSession`, which lives next
 * door and is drilled. What guards it instead is
 * `src/lib/dynamicBundle.test.ts`, which walks the static import graph from
 * `main.tsx` and fails if `@dynamic-labs` ever reappears on it. That is the
 * property that actually broke last time, and it is not a coverage property.
 *
 * `src/lib/sendLegs.ts` and `src/lib/walletProver.ts` went IN on 2026/09/02.
 * Both were written on 2026/09/02 WITH their drills — `sendLegs.test.ts` and
 * `walletProver.test.ts` — and both were left out of this list, which is worse
 * than an exclusion with a reason: their coverage was being measured and then
 * thrown away, so the 100% bar was a percentage of a denominator that quietly
 * did not include the two newest rules in `src/lib`.
 *
 * `sendLegs.ts` is the record a two-leg payment survives a reload in, and every
 * function in it decides what happens to value that has already left somebody's
 * account: which stored rows may be resumed, whether a failed leg is worth
 * retrying, how long to wait, and what the person is told about where their
 * money is. Dropping a row is losing a payment; retrying an unretryable one is
 * spending twice. It holds no React, no DOM, no `fetch`, no storage, and no
 * clock — the orchestrator in `App.tsx` does all of that and hands it what came
 * back — so all of it is drilled directly.
 *
 * Admitting it cost one test. `walletProver.ts` was already whole, but
 * `sendLegs.ts` came in at 98.54% of branches: `serialisePendingSends` writes
 * its optional keys as conditional spreads, and the run that omits BOTH
 * `withdrawTxHash` and `expectedNote` — a `withdraw` record written before the
 * first leg is submitted, the one moment in a payment where nothing has been
 * spent yet — was the only shape no drill had. That is not an accident of
 * counting: it is the record that decides whether a person who reloads mid-pay
 * is offered their money back, so `sendLegsRecord.test.ts` — a file this
 * change writes, beside the module's existing suite rather than inside it —
 * closes it. The other three optional keys were already covered by the drills
 * around it, and the existing suite is left exactly as its author wrote it.
 *
 * `walletProver.ts` is the wallet's own proving path: it is the module that
 * keeps the proof server's URL PATH, which is the whole of the shielded-send
 * failure it was written to fix, and it carries the failover between proof
 * servers for the wallet's circuits. Its network is injected as a
 * `ProvingProviderLike`, so the rules — the path, the order servers are tried
 * in, the provider being built once, and the refusal that tells midnight-js the
 * server resolves the protocol builtins itself — are drilled against a local
 * HTTP server rather than a real prover.
 *
 * `src/identity/custodyContractSigning.ts` went IN on 2026/09/16, the day it was written,
 * and it is in the denominator because every function in it decides what a key
 * SIGNS. The custody account contract gates each asset-releasing circuit on a
 * signature over a challenge, and that signature is single-use: the wrong
 * digest, the wrong envelope id, or two signature scalars read out of the bytes
 * in the wrong order all produce a call the circuit refuses AFTER somebody has
 * been asked to approve it. None of those are visible from inside the app — a
 * refused proof looks the same whichever of them caused it — so the rules are
 * held directly, and two of them are held against evidence rather than against
 * themselves: the digest fixtures are the values the compiled contract's own
 * `envelope_digest` pure circuit returned, and the signature round trip goes
 * back through the curve rather than comparing bigints to bigints.
 *
 * The module holds no React, no DOM, no network, no storage, and no contract
 * module: the compiled contract's pure circuits are INJECTED, which is what
 * makes it drillable at all — the real build is ~100 MB of prover keys that a
 * unit test cannot load. It is not wired into the app; `App.tsx` is untouched.
 *
 * `src/identity/custodyJubjubSigner.ts` went IN on 2026/09/18, the day it was
 * written, and it is in the denominator for the same reason as its neighbour
 * one turn harder: it decides what the PASSKEY signs, and unlike the k256 arm
 * there is no vendor between the rule and the key. Four rules live in it and
 * each has exactly one right answer. The DERIVATION decides which key a
 * reinstalled Passport comes back as — get the label, the counter byte, or the
 * endianness wrong and the account is intact on chain with a device set nobody
 * can sign for, which is not a bug anybody can repair afterwards. The
 * REJECTION bound decides whether the scalar is uniform or quietly biased. The
 * GRIND decides whether a challenge is in the subgroup at all, and it reads the
 * hash LITTLE-endian while the derivation reads its own BIG-endian — two
 * conventions one letter apart in the source and a universe apart in the
 * result. The NONCE decides whether a second signature reveals the secret:
 * Schnorr gives `sk` to anyone who sees two signatures under one `R`.
 *
 * None of that is visible from inside the app — every one of those failures is
 * the same refused proof — so all of it is held against something other than
 * itself in `custodyJubjubSigner.test.ts`: the seven challenge builders and the
 * three derivations are compared with the COMPILED contract's own pure
 * circuits, called directly in the generated argument order; the signature is
 * compared with the reference signer's rule re-implemented from
 * `nicolas-ref/contract/src/wallet/signer.ts`; and the result is put back
 * through the curve — `s·G == R + c·pk`, the equation the circuit checks —
 * using the runtime's own point arithmetic. The module holds no React, no DOM,
 * no network, no storage, and no curve library: the pure circuits are injected,
 * as next door.
 *
 * `src/identity/custodyContractPlan.ts` went IN on 2026/09/16, beside it, and for the
 * same kind of reason one step further out: it holds the decisions a custody deploy
 * makes BEFORE anything is signed. Three of them cost a sponsored transaction
 * when they are wrong and cannot be checked by running the flow. A wave plan
 * that leaves `activate_initial_device_with_k256` out of wave 1 deploys an
 * account nobody can ever open, and no later wave can repair it. A proving
 * endpoint on the wrong origin is a 404 arriving after a proof has been waited
 * for — and the endpoint does not exist yet, so nothing else in the tree can
 * hold it. A stale use counter derives a device entry the ledger does not hold,
 * and the call is refused in-circuit after the holder has approved it. It holds
 * no React, no DOM, no network and no contract module; its storage is an
 * injected three-method interface.
 *
 * `src/identity/custodyContractSession.ts` and `src/identity/custodyContractSend.ts` went IN
 * on 2026/09/16, the day they were written, on the same rule as the two modules
 * above: they are the DECISIONS of the Dynamic-only path with none of its
 * wiring. Which of the two identities a render belongs to, which step a setup is
 * on and what it says, whether a resolved name is a Passport this sign-in can
 * open, which deposit circuit a recipient's build takes, and whether a payment
 * can be planned at all — all pure functions of their arguments, with an
 * injected three-method storage where they touch storage at all.
 *
 * Every one of them is a way of telling somebody an untruth about their own
 * Passport if it is wrong: showing a passkey holder somebody else's Passport,
 * telling a person a name is not theirs because a read timed out, or planning a
 * payment whose second leg names a circuit the recipient does not have. Their
 * sockets — the wallet, the sponsor, the proof service, the screen — are
 * `src/screens/DynamicPassport.tsx`, which stays out with the rest of the
 * `.tsx`.
 *
 * `src/identity/custodyContractClient.ts` is deliberately OUT, and it is the sibling
 * of the module above rather than an oversight. It is the half with the sockets
 * on the end of it: a wallet, a sponsor, an indexer, a proof service that does
 * not exist yet, and midnight-js's deploy and call entry points. Every decision
 * it makes has been lifted into `custodyContractPlan.ts` precisely so that what is
 * left is wiring, and it is drilled through its injected `CustodyDeps` seams in
 * `custodyContractClient.test.ts` rather than being held to a percentage that would
 * only measure how much of midnight-js a fake can imitate.
 *
 *   assert-shim.ts      A three-line stand-in for Node's `assert`, aliased in
 *                       by `vite.config.ts` for @subsquid/scale-codec. It has
 *                       no behaviour of ours in it.
 *   bufferPolyfill.ts   Assigns `globalThis.Buffer`. A test that imported it
 *                       would change the process it runs in.
 *   indexerTx.ts        Every function is an indexer query or a WebSocket
 *                       subscription. A mocked indexer proves nothing about an
 *                       indexer; `e2e/stagenet.live.spec.ts` reads the real one.
 *   localWallet.ts      The wallet facade: WASM ledger, proof server, chain
 *                       sync. It cannot open without a live indexer.
 *   passkeyPresence.ts  WebAuthn. Drilled through a CDP virtual authenticator
 *                       in `e2e/`, which is the only place it can be.
 *   proofWorker.ts      A `Worker` bootstrap.
 *   wasmProver.ts       Instantiates the proving WASM module.
 *   registry.ts         Reads contract state through the indexer provider.
 *   theme.ts            Reads and writes the document element and
 *                       `matchMedia`.
 *   txApproval.ts       Builds and proves transactions through the wallet.
 *   walletSnapshot.ts   Serialises the SDK's own sync state.
 *
 * WHAT IS OUT, AND WHY — `src/identity`
 * -------------------------------------
 *   accountCustody.ts   MIXED, and out for that reason. Its pure half — the
 *                       byte helpers and `decodeAccountState` — IS drilled, in
 *                       `src/identity/accountCustody.test.ts`, against a ledger
 *                       produced by executing the real contract's constructor
 *                       and circuits. Its other half moves money: `deploy`,
 *                       `withdraw_night`, `withdraw_shielded`, `deposit_*`,
 *                       each needing a wallet, a proof server, and a chain.
 *                       Putting the whole file in a 100% denominator would
 *                       either make the gate unmeetable or make it meaningless.
 *                       The moving half is drilled against stagenet by
 *                       `e2e/stagenet.live.spec.ts`.
 *   midnames.ts         MIXED, on the same rule. The naming rules it used to
 *                       hold are now `./midnamesText.ts`, which IS in the
 *                       denominator above. The read-side helpers —
 *                       `normalizePassportAlias`, `aliasCostAtomicNight`,
 *                       `decodeDomainTarget`, `formatNight`,
 *                       `deriveMidnamesOwnerKey`, `suggestAliasAlternatives` —
 *                       are drilled in `src/identity/midnames.test.ts`. The
 *                       rest is registry reads against a network's own indexer.
 * `src/identity/midnamesText.ts` went IN on 2026/09/01, the day it was split
 * out of `midnames.ts`, and it is in the denominator because it is now the ONLY
 * definition of what a Passport name may be: the label grammar, the reserved
 * list, the `.night` suffix, and the alternatives offered when a name is taken.
 * Every way it can be wrong is permanent — a label that normalises to something
 * other than what the registry will store is a name registered, publicly and
 * irreversibly, to a string the user did not type, and a reserved name that
 * slips through is `midnight.night` reading as an official account. It exists
 * as a separate file precisely so it can be imported without a ledger, so it
 * holds no DOM, no React, no network, no clock, and — by construction — no
 * imports at all. The drills did not move either: `midnames.test.ts` exercises
 * every one of these through `midnames.ts`'s re-export, which is where the rest
 * of the app still reads them from.
 *
 * `src/identity/aliasStore.ts` went IN on 2026/09/04, and it is the clearest
 * case yet of a file that was excluded for what it looked like rather than for
 * what it decided. It sat with the other two thin stores above on the grounds
 * that it was `localStorage` records with a few invariants, exercised for real
 * by `backup.test.ts`. What that missed is that its KEY was a decision about
 * identity: it was keyed by network alone, so the answer to "what is this
 * Passport's name" did not depend on which passkey was asking. A credential
 * enrolled seconds earlier read the previous one's name, the name step saw a
 * record and skipped itself, and Home printed a name over an account that
 * belonged to a different passkey — the Android orphan reported that day, which
 * a user could not escape by any means the app offered. The store now decides
 * two genuinely hard things — whose record a reader may see, and which
 * credential may adopt a record written before any of them were labelled — and
 * `aliasStore.test.ts` holds both at 100%.
 *
 * `src/identity/k1CoinStore.ts` went IN on 2026/09/16 with the module itself,
 * and it is in the denominator because of what it holds rather than because of
 * how much of it there is. A custody account's qualified shielded coins exist in
 * exactly one place — this store — and the chain carries no copy: a description
 * this module drops, mangles, or hands back under the wrong colour is a balance
 * nobody can ever spend again, discovered at proving time with nothing to point
 * at. Every branch in it is either a row it refuses to read back or a write it
 * refuses to make, and both are met in `k1CoinStore.test.ts`. It holds no DOM,
 * no React, no wallet SDK, and no network — the one thing it cannot do for
 * itself, asking the indexer where a transaction's outputs landed, is INJECTED
 * as a reader, and the real one (`contractRuntime.ts`'s
 * `resolveTxCommitmentWindowOnce`) sits on the far side of that seam, in a
 * module that is out for the reason given below.
 *
 * `src/identity/custodyInbox.ts` went IN on 2026/09/16 with the module itself, and
 * it is the file in this list with the least room for a percentage below a
 * hundred. It is a WIRE FORMAT: the bytes it writes are read by a program that
 * is not this one, written by people who are not here, possibly a year from
 * now, and a coin whose entry cannot be opened is a coin nobody can ever move
 * again. Every branch is either a byte-layout decision, a skip rule the
 * specification states in words (§6.4, §6.5), or a refusal to seal something
 * that would open as nonsense, and all three are drilled in `custodyInbox.test.ts`
 * against fixtures generated by the REFERENCE implementation rather than by
 * this one. It holds no DOM, no React, and no network: keys, bytes, and an
 * injected reader.
 *
 * `src/identity/custodyInboxIndex.ts` went IN on 2026/09/17 with the module
 * itself. It answers "which transaction wrote inbox entry k" by COUNTING a
 * contract's action history, and the count is the only thing standing between a
 * recovered coin and a confident wrong position in the commitment tree — which
 * proves nothing, for ever, while looking perfectly spendable. Every branch is
 * either an entry point read off the compiled build as one that appends, one
 * that may append and therefore stops the count, or a row the answer did not
 * carry; all three are drilled in `custodyInboxIndex.test.ts`. It holds no
 * network: a GraphQL document out, somebody else's answer in.
 *
 * `src/lib/custodyAssets.ts` went IN on 2026/09/17 with the module itself. It is
 * what the Dynamic Passport's Home and Send read money through: which rows
 * exist, what each is called, how many decimal places an amount of it carries,
 * and what a typed amount means in atomic units. Both halves have an expensive
 * wrong answer — a decimal scale applied to a colour that has none sends a
 * millionth of what somebody typed, and a coin left off the rows is money the
 * holder cannot see — so every branch is drilled in `custodyAssets.test.ts`,
 * including the copy rule that none of its sentences names a vendor, a fee
 * token, or a piece of machinery.
 *
 * `src/lib/custodyDelivery.ts` went IN on 2026/09/17 with the module itself. It
 * decides ONE thing — whether a shielded payment into an account that keeps no
 * readable balance was seen to arrive — and both wrong answers are a sentence
 * on a screen that is not true: "they were paid" over a payment the network
 * refused, or "not confirmed" over one that is demonstrably there. The list it
 * walks is public and grows for everybody's payments, so the difference between
 * "it grew" and "OUR delivery is in it" is the whole of the module, and the
 * third answer — a list this build could not read at all — must never collapse
 * into either. It holds no network, no clock, and no contract: an injected
 * reader, two positions, and the bytes.
 *
 * `src/lib/custodyScreenRules.ts` went IN on 2026/09/17 with the module itself.
 * It holds the three decisions `src/screens/DynamicPassport.tsx` makes about
 * somebody's money that are invisible while they are being made, which is why
 * they are not left in a `.tsx` the denominator excludes: whether to put a note
 * back after the last leg of a payment threw (a note that is GONE must never be
 * re-sent — the node refuses the double spend, after the screen has said it is
 * coming home), whether a second piece of work may start while one is running
 * (two of them read and write one coin store), and what a walk's unplaceable
 * deliveries mean for the figure of payments still arriving (arriving, not
 * balance, and not nothing). No React, no storage, no network, no wallet: the
 * values the screen already holds go in and a decision comes out.
 *
 * `src/lib/custodyNameFirst.ts` went IN on 2026/09/22 with the module itself.
 * It decides which of the three screens somebody making a Passport is on, and
 * the reason it cannot live in the `.tsx` is that two of its answers are only
 * ever seen after something has gone wrong. A reload halfway through a
 * three-step setup must come back to the name already chosen rather than to an
 * introduction; a name taken by somebody else between the choosing and the
 * claim must cost the name and NOT the account that was just built. Neither is
 * reachable by walking the happy path, and both are a Passport lost or a
 * stranger's name shown if they are wrong. No React, no storage, no network.
 *
 * `src/identity/timestamps.ts` went IN on 2026/08/26 with the module itself: it
 * is the ISO-8601 reader `backup.ts` and `incentiveStore.ts` now share, it is
 * four lines of pure decision, and both of its answers are drilled by
 * `backup.test.ts`.
 *
 *   incentiveStore.ts,  Thin `window.localStorage` records. They are exercised
 *   passportContract-   for real (not mocked) by `backup.test.ts`, which
 *   Store.ts            restores through their own save functions so their
 *                       invariants are the ones enforced.
 *   callbackLaunch.ts,  The dApp callback protocol: `window.opener`,
 *   callbackProtocol.ts `postMessage`, and cross-origin handshakes.
 *   contractRuntime.ts  Loads the compiled contract modules and the ledger
 *                       WASM, and builds midnight-js providers.
 *   passportContract.ts Deploys and calls the pilot contract.
 *
 * WHAT IS OUT, AND WHY — everything else
 * --------------------------------------
 *   `src/verify/**`     The step verifier: a separate, read-only operator page
 *                       served at `/verify/`. Every function in it is either an
 *                       indexer query, a contract-state decode behind one, or
 *                       DOM construction — the same three reasons `indexerTx.ts`
 *                       and the `.tsx` files are out. It is exercised against
 *                       the real stagenet indexer in a headless browser, which
 *                       is the only place its answers mean anything.
 *   `*.tsx`, `main.tsx`, `pwa.tsx`, `backend.ts`, `publicProfile.ts`
 *                       React components and the browser bring-up around them.
 *                       There is no jsdom in this workspace and adding one
 *                       would only let a test assert against a fake DOM; the
 *                       screens are drilled in a real browser, against a real
 *                       passkey, by `e2e/onboarding.spec.ts`. The pure helpers
 *                       that used to live in `App.tsx` were moved OUT of it
 *                       for this reason — see `src/lib/activation.ts` and
 *                       `src/lib/colour.ts`, both of which are in the
 *                       denominator at 100%.
