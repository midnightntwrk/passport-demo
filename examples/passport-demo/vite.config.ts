 * shipped an identical worker and no update was detected at all — the incident
 * this plugin exists to prevent is written up in `public/sw.js`'s own header.

 * only when, the client the worker has to serve changes — so a rebuild with no
 * source change stamps the same id and installs no needless worker.
 *

 * the output directory, well before the bundle is written, so `dist/sw.js` is
 * already there and this is a rewrite of it rather than a race with the copy.

         `dist/verify/index.html`, so the URL stays `/verify/`.
